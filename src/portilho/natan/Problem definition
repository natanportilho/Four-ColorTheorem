The Four Color problem is one of the most famous problems in Mathematics. The problem consists of
the question whether any map can be colored using four colors in such a way that adjacent regions
(i.e. those sharing a common boundary segment, not just a point) receive different colors. This
problem has been formulated first by Francis Guthrie in 1852 (published in 1878) and was unsolved for
roughly a century. Wolfgang Haken und Kenneth Appel could prove the four color theorem with the help
of a computer program in 1977 .

Consider the political map of the South-Eastern states of the USA (states North Carolina, South
Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida). How
can we color this map with the four color theorem using a Genetic Algorithm?
